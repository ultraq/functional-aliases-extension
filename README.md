Functional Aliases Extension
============================

Adds functional method aliases (filter/map/reduce) for existing Groovy methods.

This code is totally the work of Juan Vazquez, which he has blogged about in his
post, [Add Map, Reduce, and Filter to Groovy with an Extension Module](http://javazquez.com/juan/2013/02/05/add-map-reduce-and-filter-to-groovy-with-groovy-extension-modules/).
I just wanted this thing to exist on Maven so I could import it into existing
projects :)
